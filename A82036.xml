            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Declaration againſt the ANTINONIANS, and their Doctrine of Liberty.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the <hi>Antinomians,</hi> by their dangerous and wicked concluſions, which they falſly gather from Gods free grace, hath of late yeares been ſo farre ſpread, and corrupted ſo many people, I have thought good to declare what blaſphemy is taught therein; and have briefly and fully gathered ſuch teſtimonies againſt them, as I hope will be ſufficient to ſatisfie any reaſonable man: And yet no blemiſh at all ariſe to the glory of Gods free grace.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>They ſay, that God never inflicts puniſhment upon the Eloct for their ſinnes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is directly againſt the Word of God, and a very dangerous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be taught; for if we look upon the deareſt of Gods people, we ſhall finde them often under the rod for their ſins. The Iſraelites to whom God ſaith that he is the Lord their God, (<hi>Levit.</hi> 26.13.) and tels them that he will remember the Covenant that he may be their God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 44.45. Yet for all that, in the 14.16. and 18. verſes, the Lord threatens them, that if they ſin and forſake his Commandements to do wickedly, the Lord will ſend many plagues upon them, and will ſet his face againſt them, and deſtroy them by the Enemy. And if they go on in their ſins, the Lord tels them that he will puniſh them ſeven times more for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Who can have greater aſſurance of being an Elect childe of God, then good <hi>David</hi> had; yet becauſe he ſinned, God often puniſhed him. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he cried out, Lord I am afflicted and ready to die, from my youth up; while I ſuffer thy terrours I am diſtracted. Thy fierce wrath
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:154846:3"/>goeth over me, thy terrours have cut me off, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 88.15, 16. Is not death it ſelfe a puniſhment for ſin, the wages of ſin is death ſaith Paul, Rom. 6 23.</p>
            <p>This Doctrine of thirs is a very nurſery for wickedneſſe and vice, for if men may cozen and cheat; and under a ſhew of Religion, cloake over their ſins with a ſeeming profeſſion, onely if a man be perſwaded that God hath Elected him, and therefore whatſoever ſinnes he committs God will never call him to account for it, nor lay any puniſhment upon him, neither in this life nor in the life to come, it is no wonder that ſuch a man, hearkens to the motives of the fleſh, to follow that which is evill; and ſo that he can but hide it from the eyes of the world, take his fill of ſin, in Gluttony and Drunkenneſſe, Whoring, Cozening, and all manner of ſecret wickedneſſe, If a man be perſwaded that God will never call him to reckoning, what need he care how he lives, ſo the world ſee it not, like the Heathen, who ſay, God is a good maſter and will not beat them, and therefore becauſe they feare the divell, they are afraid to offend him, but preſume upon Gods goodneſſe, and ſerve the Devill in all wickedneſſe.</p>
            <p n="2">II. They ſay that <hi>God is never angry with his children.</hi> A full place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this errour is, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 38.3. <hi>There is,</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>no ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in my fleſh, becauſe of thine anger: neither is there any reſt in my bones b cauſe of my ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do wonder what thoughts they have of God, who thinke the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be ſuch a one, as will let them live in ſin, and do any filthineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and yet never once be ſo much as angry with them, ſurely the Heathen have higher thoughts of their Idolds; Can a man endure to ſee himſelfe abuſed (as all men by ſin diſhonour God) and ſtand by and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſame, and yet not be angry, and ſhall we think that the Great God of Heaven and Earth is not provoked to anger, when his children ſin againſt him. Nay the truth of it is, that by the ſins of his own people, God is moſt of all provoked, in ſo much that if they provoked him by ſuch wickedneſſe, as ungodly men do, and follow Wine, and Wenching, and profane liberty, God will make his anger ſmoake againſt them, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 7 4, 1. But theſe <hi>Antinomians</hi> are like Achemon, who was a fellow that lived in all kinde of wickedneſſe and cruelty, oppreſſing his negh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by all kinde of injuries, and inhumane outrages, and thought that no evill could befall him, and ſhortly after he was caught by <hi>Hercules,</hi> as the Poets write of him, and hanged by the heeles at his club. And let thoſe who have ſuch unworthy conceits of God, preſume as much as they will of Gods mercy, which is very large and gracio<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s to thoſe that feare him, yet this is certain, that if they carry ſuch proud inſulting thoughts in their hearts againſt God, if they repent not: they ſhall one
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:154846:3"/>day finde, not <hi>Hercules</hi> (concerning whom it matters not for the truth of that ſtory) but a company of Divels to carry them to Hell, and thruſt them thither by the head and ſhoulders.</p>
            <p n="3">III. They ſay, that <hi>God ſees no ſin in his children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſo apparent a blaſphemy againſt Gods truth, that it ſtrikes at one of his own Attributes; and denies God to be Omniſcient, for if any thing be hid from his knowledge God cannot be ſaid to be Omniſcient. He that formed the eye, ſhall not he ſee, he that teacheth man know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſhall not hee know. The Lord knoweth the thoughts of man that they are but vanity. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. The whole Pſalme is againſt them.</p>
            <p>This doctrine of theirs keeps men back from examination of their ſinnes, and powring out their ſoules before God, by humble and hearty repentance, the onely comfort that Chriſtians finde (of all intercour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) between God and their ſoules; It may be if theſe men would lay down this fond opinion and fall to examination, and confeſſe their ſinns unto Almighty God, the Lord might be pleaſed to enlighten their ſoules and give them better knowledge of him. If they would I ſay go to God, and in their cloſets confeſſe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Imprimis.</hi> Such a day I offended the Lord by coſening and cheating ſuch a neighbour, and ſuch a friend ſo and ſo, and why ſhould I not make reſtitution of it again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi> Such a day I was drunke, and I waſted and ſpoiled the good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of our God, and ſpewed them upon the ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi> At ſuch a time I offended God by the filthy ſin of Adultery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi> So many Sabbaths I have profaned, ſo many opportunities of grace I have ſlighted, ſo many good people I have ſeduced, and ſhall I thinke that the Almighty Omnipotent God ſees not theſe things.</p>

            <p>But God loves his elect, not as they are ſinfull, but as they are in Chriſt becauſe of Election, and in that reſpect they are greatly beloved of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. But as they are ſinners, and as God looks upon them in the act, they are not beloved of God: Thoſe who are in the fleſh, and walk in ſin cannot pleaſe God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7, 8. Living in ſin, eſtates a man in one condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the election of grace in anothe.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:154846:4"/>
            <p> In reſpect of the perſon, God may be ſaid to love a man that is in ſin, becauſe of Election, and fore-knowing his repentance and faith; but as he is in a ſinfull condition, God loves no man: Whoſoever is born of God doth not commit ſin <hi>(allowing of it in his heart)</hi> for his ſeed remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him (ſaith <hi>Iohn</hi>) and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.9.</p>
            <p>A man may ſay of <hi>Ornus,</hi> that if the Aſſe was beaten away he might make up his Ropes, but as faſt as he twiſts, the Aſſe ſtands by and bites them off (as the Poets have feigned) and ſo may I ſay of theſe men; if they could beat the Divell away, it were a manifeſtation of Election, and God would love them; but they cannot beat the divell away whilſt they practiſe and allow of ſin, and have ſuch baſe thoughts of God; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, there can appear no manifeſtation of their Election; except they caſt away the deeds of darkneſſe, and put on Chriſt the Armour of light, and then is a ſigne they have put on Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. the latter end.</p>
            <p>Do you think that God will love you, or manifeſt any love unto you whilſt you take liberty in ſin, and teach men ſo; and encourage one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſuch wicked wayes. No, aſſure your ſelves God hates ſin, and all the ſinfull wayes of man: And therefore depart from evill, and do good, and dwell in the love and favour of God for ever. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.27.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>They ſay, that ſanctification of life in duties of Pietie, is nothing at all eſteemed of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let me tell thoſe who are of this opinion, that although a ſanctified life do not juſtifie us, yet the ſervants of God before they can attain ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, they muſt have their fruit unto holineſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.22. And in the 5. Chapter of <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpell, Chriſt teacheth his Diſciples, and in them us alſo, how exactly he requires of thoſe that will be ſaved, to live in an holy and godly converſation. But this damnable doctrine of b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ating down a ſanctified, ſpirituall, pious, and holy life, is a dangerous erro<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, and gives way exceedingly to looſeneſſe, and none can be imagi-more dangerous in that kinde then it is; tending to the ruine and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of a nation, both Church and State.</p>
            <p>This makes no difference between a mans own wife and his neighbors, his own goods, and others, never checks his luſts, nor ſtayes his malice, it cannot ſtop his mouth from drunkenneſſe, nor his heart from pride, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, and all manner of evill; every man like <hi>Ixion</hi> in hell, may turn the wheel of their inventions continually, and ſtill be the ſame men; and like <hi>Aceſſius</hi> ſtay for a better Moon then Aſtrologers could ever yet diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and when they have done, conclude with the Preacher, ſaying, <hi>I ſaid I will be wiſe but it was farre from me.</hi> Eccleſ. 7.23.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:154846:4"/>
            <p> Without doubt every honeſt man, that truely feares God, hath a great reſpect to duties of Piety, and to performe them with great reverence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Almighty God, trembling to thinke of thoſe imperfections and failings which he findes in himſelfe, his ſins coſt him many a ſob and ſigh, and often groanes before God, for almighty God hath promiſed to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle up all ſuch teares, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.8.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>They ſay that that the godly finde no difficulties in the way to heaven, but live in much pleaſure and delight in this world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is Contrary to what our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt taught; that thoſe that go to heaven ſtrive for it, and exhorting his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to take paines in ſo difficult and hard a worke, he tels them plainly that the reaſon why it doth ſo much concerne them, to ſtrive for Heaven, is, becauſe the way is ſo exceeding ſtraight, that many ſhall ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24.</p>
            <p>And when the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> that were Converted to the Faith of Chriſt were caſt into priſon, and contradicted by wicked and ſinfull men, railing againſt them, at which they began to be much troubled, <hi>Paul</hi> told them that they muſt expect yet greater Difficulties then they had ſuffered, if they would be ſaved, they have not yet reſiſted unto blood (ſaith he) ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aginſt ſin.</p>
            <p>It is true, the yoke of Chriſt is eaſie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11 30. (but yet it is a Yoke) for the yoke of ſin bowes a man to eternall damnation in Hell; ſo in that reſpect the yoke of Chriſt, though it be a Yoke is an eaſie one, but theſe men draw out a fatall concluſion from hence, to give way to an idle and lazy life: But there is a woe denounced againſt thoſe that are at eaſe (yea even) in Zion <hi>Amos</hi> 6.1.</p>
            <p>And thoſe that teach this looſeneſſe in liberty to ſin, are like the lewd Srumpet: <hi>Ezekel.</hi> 23. <hi>When the voice of a multitude being at eaſe was with her, and with the men of the common ſort, were brought drunken Sabeans from the wilderneſſe, which put bracelets upon their hands, and beautifull Crownes upon their heads, for which God procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded againſt them, as againſt ſhedders of blood.</hi> And let them remember what the Preachet ſaith, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.9. Remember that for all theſe things thou ſhalt come to judgement.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>They ſay that thoſe who belong to God, are able in this world per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to diſtinguiſh betwixt Gods people and the wicked.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſomething like a mean pillar of the Church of Rome, <hi>Rhemiſt Anotati.</hi> in Iohn 14. verſe 16. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> pleads hrad for it. <hi>That the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church cannot poſsibly erre, not only in matters abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, but in any thing which it impoſeth and commandeth, whether it be contained in the Word of God or not.</hi> Bellarmin. <hi>De Eccleſ. lib.</hi> 3 <hi>cap.</hi> 14.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:154846:5"/>By the Church here they mean not only the Miniſters or Governours of the Church (as Doctor <hi>Willet</hi> obſerves in Sinopſis) but the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the faithfull.</p>
            <p>But the contrary is proved by Scripture. 1. Before the comming of Chriſt, the Jewiſh Church erred. 2 Kings 3.14.4. And ſecondly, in Chriſts time the Church erred; Math. 26.22. And laſtly, ſince Chriſts time the famous Churches of Corinth. Galatia, &amp;c. have erred: 1 Cor. 6 5. 1 Cor. 15.13. 1 Cor. 11.21. Gal. 3.1. But eſpecially that place of Scripture is moſt full to clear this, Rev. 2.17. where it is ſaid; To him that overcommeth will I give to eat of the hidden Manna, and will give him a white ſtone, and in the ſtone a new name written, which no man knoweth, ſaving he that receiveth it.</p>
            <p>How then, or from whence ſhall any in theſe times, have ſuch cleere judgements to diſcern more then any other men that ever were in the world. <hi>Quomodo erit Eccleſia in iſto tempore, perfecta ſine macula &amp; ruga cujus membra non mendaciter, confiteantur ſe habere <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

How can the Church be perfect in this life, without ſpot or wrinkle, whoſe members do truly confeſſe, that they are not without ſin. And as themſelves have ſometimes confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>Iudicium Eccleſiae non nunquam opinionem ſequitur, quam &amp; fallere ſaepe contingit falli.</hi> The judgement of the Church is many times ruled by opinion, which both may deceive and be deceived. <hi>Decret.
